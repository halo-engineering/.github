# Organization-wide GitHub Templates

This repository contains organization-wide templates for GitHub pull requests and issues, designed to standardize our workflow and improve integration with ClickUp.

## What's Included

- **Pull Request Template**: Ensures all PRs reference ClickUp tasks and follow standard guidelines
- **Issue Templates**:
  - **Bug Report**: Structured format for reporting bugs with ClickUp integration
  - **Feature Request**: Template for suggesting new features with ClickUp references

## How Templates Support ClickUp Integration

These templates reinforce our ClickUp-GitHub workflow by:

1. **Requiring ClickUp References**: Each template encourages linking to a ClickUp task
2. **Standardizing Format**: Ensures consistent information across all repositories
3. **Improving Traceability**: Makes it easier to track work across both systems

## How It Works

GitHub automatically uses these templates from the `.github` repository when a repository doesn't have its own templates. This allows us to:

- Maintain templates in a single place
- Ensure consistency across the organization
- Easily update templates organization-wide
